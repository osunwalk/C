After compiling we run these commands to test

./WTFServer 4200
./WTF configure twinkie 4200
Here we check configure file and it displays:
twinkie
4200

Continue with commands
./WTF create myProject
./WTF create urProject
We see myProject and urProject as local directories now
In our directory it looks like this
-myProject
   -.Manifest
-urProject
   -.Manifest
-repo
   -myProject
      -0
         -.Manifest
   -urProject
      -0
         -.Manifest

./WTF destroy doesntExist
Server output: project doesn't exist

./WTF destroy myProject
-myProject
-urProject
-repo
   -urProject
      -0
         -.Manifest

Since we didn't fully complete the project we have our own testcases with manually created files.
For add we manually created test.txt and haha.txt in our project's local directory with random text.
./WTF add urProject test.txt
./WTF add urProject haha.txt
Our local .Manifest goes from 
0

to
0
0	urProject/test.txt	b00df7c9d9eb0da7ceb32fb86c65187239e1eb00
0	urProject/haha.txt	7c4862bf4d380c9c1c7bc07a05ad71a6e85f0806

./WTF add urProject claefoefi
Output: No such file or directory

./WTF add sadklfjaslkd test.txt
Output: Error: Files do not exist

./WTF remove urProject test.txt
.Manifest becomes
0
0	urProject/haha.txt	7c4862bf4d380c9c1c7bc07a05ad71a6e85f0806

Add the file back now that we've tested remove
.Manifest becomes
0
0	urProject/test.txt	b00df7c9d9eb0da7ceb32fb86c65187239e1eb00
0	urProject/haha.txt	7c4862bf4d380c9c1c7bc07a05ad71a6e85f0806

./WTF currentversion urProject 
Output:
0	urProject/test.txt
0	urProject/haha.txt
